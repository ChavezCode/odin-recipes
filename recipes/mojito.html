       <p>A classic cuban drink for an authentic meal!</p>

       <h2><p>Description</p></h2>
       <p></p>
       This is an authentic recipe for mojito. 
       I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. 
       It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. 
       Be careful when drinking it, however. 
       If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself,
        and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time!
